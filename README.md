# Data Science Projects

This repository is a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills in the end-to-end data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to data visualization and the application of machine learning. The projects here are developed using popular Python libraries and are a testament to my commitment to continuous learning in the field. Some of these projects are based on concepts from the book Big Data Analysis with Python.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Cleaning & Visualization

This project demonstrates practical techniques for handling raw data to prepare it for analysis. The included Jupyter notebook, `data_visualizing.ipynb`, serves as a guide for data visualization.

* **Data Cleaning**: Explores methods for handling missing values, such as imputation, and other data preprocessing techniques.
* **Data Visualization**: Contains detailed examples of creating and customizing various types of graphs, including line graphs and scatter plots, using Python libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`, and `Pandas`. The visualizations are used to reveal trends and relationships within datasets, such as a sample car dataset.

## ðŸ› Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language for all projects.
* **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Powerful libraries for creating static and statistical visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary environment for project development and documentation.
* **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

##  Future Work

This repository will be continuously updated with new projects as I explore more advanced topics in data science. Upcoming projects will include:

* **Big Data**: Exploring data processing and analysis with large datasets.
* **Apache Hadoop**: Implementing projects using the Hadoop framework.
* **Apache Spark**: Applying Spark for distributed data processing and real-time analytics.
